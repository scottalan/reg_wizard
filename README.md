Reg Wizard
=========

This is a work in progress but should give you a solid idea as to how to create a registration wizard using
[Wizard Helper](https://www.drupal.org/project/wizard_helper). This is a custom module and will not fit your
use case specifically. This is intended as an example to help you build your own.

Currently Wizard Helper doesn't have a 7.x-1.x branch but it will soon. I just need to get
the updates I made to the module pushed up to Drupal. I should have a 7x branch pushed up
by March 1
